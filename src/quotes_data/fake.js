  "Edward might be one of the so-called undead, but I felt death would be a welcome relief than to live one more second without him.",
  "Rather than being afraid, I found the thought of Edward near my neck... tantalizing. Not for the first time, I found myself fervently glad that he couldn't read my thoughts.",
  `"Bella, maybe it's time that you saw a professional."`,
  "Jacob looked at the ground. He looked so sad and angry - I wanted to reach out, but I knew any touch from me would only make things worse.",
  "My heart pounded, a siren's call betraying me to both my protectors and my hunters. Jane's face remained impassive, a shadow of a cruel smirk on her beautiful porcelain features.",
  "The sound of a wolf howl leaked through the car windows, echoing painfully in my chest and reverberating there as we sped away.",
  `"What, these muscles?" Jacob jokingly flexed his bicep and then laughed, his easygoing aura crackling around him like the sun.`,
  `"Edward, I don't care if I die. If you die, I may as well be dead already."`,

  `"The vampires and werewolves thing, I couldn't care less." I said fiercely. "I just see two people - Edward and Jacob."`,
  "How could I ever explain Edward to Ren√©e? Sometimes, he still speaks like he's over a hundred years old - even though he looks seventeen.",
  "More than anything I want to hold Edward tight, so tight that it's impossible for him to go - but I'm not strong enough. Not until I become one of them.",
